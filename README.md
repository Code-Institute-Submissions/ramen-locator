# RAMEN LOCATOR
# UX
## Project Goals
Over the last 10 years, Japanese Ramen, thanks to its rich soup and tasty hand-made noodles, became extremely popular in the western world.  
I wanted to create a website that would give you more info on the types of ramen available and where to find them.  
The website is meant to be an helping hand, for both travellers and Ramen enthusiasts of any age, to either get their Ramen fix or to learn a little more on the types of Ramen available and their location.
## User Stories
### As a first time user I want:
* To know where the nearest Ramen restaurant is, so I can choose where to eat either on the same day or imminently.
* To learn about the types of Ramen available, so I can have more information on what to order next time I eat Ramen.
* To know about different types of Ramen depending on the Japanese region, so I can make an informed decision when I plan my trip.
* To sign up to the Newsletter mailer, so I can be up to date with the latest news, recipes and updates regarding the Ramen world.
* To test my Ramen skills as a recreational time.
### As a returning user I want:
* To know where the nearest Ramen restaurant is, so I can choose where to eat either on the same day or imminently.
* To know about different types of Ramen depending on the Japanese region, so I can make an informed decision when I plan my trip.
