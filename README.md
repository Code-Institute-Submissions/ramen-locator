# RAMEN LOCATOR
Over the last 10 years, Japanese Ramen, thanks to its rich soup and tasty hand-made noodles, became extremely popular in the western world.  
I wanted to create a website that would give you more info on the types of ramen available and where to find them.
## UX
The website is meant to be an helping hand, for both travellers and Ramen enthusiasts, to either get their Ramen fix or to learn a little more on the types of Ramen available and their location.
### User Stories
